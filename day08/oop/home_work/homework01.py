"""
create a Rectangle Class (width height)
it will have area and perimeter methods

create a Square class (length)
the Square class will inherit from the Rectangle class

changing the width of a square will change the height
and vice verse

add a small main code that will have a list of squares and rectangles
and will print the area of each as well as print the shape with
the largest perimeter

extra: add a Shape parent class, add a Circle class
(keeping shape empty is okay but if you want Shape to act like an abstract
 use the abc module:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html
 )
