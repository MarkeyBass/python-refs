Create a Rectangle Class (width height)
It will have area and perimeter methods

Create a Square class (length)
The Square class will inherit from the Rectangle class

Changing the width of a square will change the height and vice verse

Add  main code that will have a list of squares and rectangles and will print
the area of each as well as print the shape with the largest perimeter

Extra:
* Add a Shape parent class, add a Circle class
* Keeping Shape empty is okay, but if you want Shape to act like an abstract class
  you can use the abc module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html
